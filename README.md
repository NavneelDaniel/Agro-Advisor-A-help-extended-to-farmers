This project predicts the MSP (Minimum seling Price) of the crops for the upcoming Years on the basis of MPSs and GDPs of previous years.
Also the yield of the Crops are predicted for the upcoming year according to their seasons.

For MSP- Multilevel Linear Regression Algorithm
For Yield- Logistic Regression Alorithm

Here are two .py files each for Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
The creation of final MSP and Yield csv files is done manually inputting data of each state into the analysis codes and collecting the data into final csv files.

The final csv files are linked to the website hosted locally which is taking input from the farmers the details of them and the season and states.
The various crops are shown according to the input values.
